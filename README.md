Spring MVC Form Validation and Resource Handling (Pure Annotations)


Application containing a student registration form, on form submission validating the user-input via JSR-303 validation annotations, overriding default messages using internationalized validation messages through properties files and also access the static resources (e.g. applying Bootstrap CSS to our pages).
Please note that JSR303 is a specification and hibernate-validator we are using in this post is an implementation, which also provides few of itâ€™s own validation annotations not included in specification.
